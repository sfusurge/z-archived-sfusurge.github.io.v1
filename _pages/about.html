		<div class="about-body">SFU Surge is an all-inclusive organization to promote curiosity and excitement for the future of technology, while guiding students on their paths to career success. An innovative community which empowers students to gain access to readily available networking, and connect their shared experiences with designers, engineers, programmers and developers a-like.<br> 
				Our goal is nurture student creativity by providing an supportive environment where they can work on group projects while we offer resources, support, and other opportunities to ensure their success along the way – and give students more experience before they head out into the real world. The events challenge participants to be ambitious about their careers and end goals, with plenty of room to improve and accelerate. </div>
